# Human tower
Every athlete is characterized by his mass 'm' (in kg) and strength 's' (in kg). You are to find the maximum number of athletes that can form a tower standing one upon another. 

## Details
An athlete can hold a tower of athletes with total mass equal to his strength or less than his strength. 
Input contains the number of athletes n and their parameters. 
These inputs can be assumed to be passed as arguments (Integer n and List<Pair<Integer, Integer>> parameterList) appropriate for your language of choice.

For example:
```
n
m1 s1
m2 s2
...
mn sn
```

If `mi > mj` then `si > sj`, but athletes with equal masses can be of different strength.

Number of athletes `n < 100000`. Masses and strengths are positive integers less than 2000000.

For example:

Input #1
```
4
3 4
2 2
7 6
4 5
```

Would yield 
Output #1

`3`
